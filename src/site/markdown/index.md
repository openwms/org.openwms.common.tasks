# Intention
This service is used to manage human user tasks in a warehouse. These general tasks are not specific to the WMS domain and can be used very
flexible whereas WMS specific tasks (as part of the [WMS Tasks Service](https://github.com/openwms/org.openwms.wms.tasks)) are more specific
and can cover more detailed WMS information.
